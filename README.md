## Description

Bootcamp Project 2: A pantry organization app with a whole lot of personality.
Users who want to keep impeccable track of the food in their kitchens can create an account, which comes with a virtual fridge, freezer, pantry, and shopping list--and the option to add, delete, or rename as many new locations as they like in order to fully customize their kitchen to fit their needs. The Cado family (Ava, Barry, and little Cara) will keep watch over your kitchen while you're away, and help make sure you use all your food before it goes bad.

[Deployed on Heroku](https://quiet-sands-24336.herokuapp.com/).

## Usage


Barry Cado isn't supposed to talk to strangers, so introduce yourself first--or, pretend to be his wife to help him feel more comfortable! Login with the following credentials to test out our app.

Email: ava@cado.com
Password: Cados4Life

If don't want to enter into this relationship under false pretenses, click the "Sign Up" button in the top right-hand corner of the page and enter your email address and desired password to create an account of your own. If you already have an account, enter your email and password and click "Login" to view your food!
Once logged in, click the hamburger menu on the top right-hand corner for options to add or edit your kitchen. Click "Add Food To Inventory" and enter food name, brand, expiration date, and amount--and don't forget to answer the all-important question: is this food cheese?
Click "Create New Location" to add a new location, or rename or delete your existing locations. 
Once you've added food to your inventory, the tabs at the bottom of the screen will populate with your existing food. If it's fresh, Cara Cado will appear next to the food letting you know it's good to go. If it's nearing its expiration date, Ava Cado will pop up reminding you to use it. If it's spoiled, the Count will let you know it's time to toss. And, of course, you'll get a handy-dandy cheese icon reminding you which of your foods are cheese. Click the trash can icon to delete a food, and the "Move to Shopping List" icon to remind yourself to buy more. 
Last but not least, click on Ava Cado in the top left-hand side of the screen for your daily dose of solid life advice. This feature is available whether you're logged in or not, because let's face it, none of us really know what we're doing in life and Ava is here to remind us of that.
And remember, be humorous, stay hydrated, and in a pinch, comment on the awkwardness of it all.
